# TimeWise

## Inspiration
The genesis of TimeWise stems from the common struggle of effectively managing personal schedules amidst the complexities of daily life. Our team found inspiration in the challenges of simplifying the process of planning a personal timetable. Key influences include the versatility of ChatGPT in handling JSON output mode and the functionality of the iCalendar format. These elements underscored the potential for integrating advanced technology to streamline and optimize time management.

## What it does
TimeWise leverages Generative AI to revolutionize how users manage their daily schedules. By accepting natural language inputs, regardless of their length or complexity, TimeWise enables users to effortlessly create a comprehensive array of events tailored to their everyday lives. This intuitive interface allows for the seamless generation of events, which can then be conveniently integrated into users' personal or professional calendars with a simple tap.

## How we built it
Our journey in developing TimeWise was founded on collaboration and dedication, with our team members often working through the night to bring our vision to life. Utilizing a robust toolkit comprising Python, OpenAI's API, web development technologies (HTML, JavaScript, JSON, PHP), and the iCalendar format, we crafted a solution that marries the power of AI with user-friendly design.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development process, we encountered several hurdles, including the propensity for Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce delusional outputs and potential errors in message processing due to OpenAI's backend. These challenges tested our problem-solving skills and pushed us to seek innovative solutions to ensure reliability and user satisfaction.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of our most significant achievements is TimeWise's capability to transform users' natural language input, whether it is just one line of scentence or very long and detailed descriptions, directly into a calendar event configuration file. This functionality facilitates effortless integration with various calendar systems, allowing users to add events to their calendars with unparalleled ease. We take pride in this feature, as it encapsulates our goal of simplifying time management for everyone.

## What we learned
The development of TimeWise was an enlightening experience that highlighted the complexities involved in bringing an idea to fruition. It emphasized the importance of becoming well-versed in the technological tools at our disposal and the energy required to navigate the challenges of software development.

## What's next for TimeWise
Looking forward, we aim to enhance TimeWise's user interface (GUI), making it even more intuitive and accessible. Additionally, we plan to expand our AI capabilities by integrating more Large Language Model options from various platforms, such as Gemini and Claude. Our goal is to support a broader array of user calendar accounts through API integration, catering to a wider audience and further simplifying the scheduling process.
